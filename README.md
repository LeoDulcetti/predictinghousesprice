## Predicting House prices in Madrid 
The main objecdtive of this project is predicting house prices in Madrid. 
I started with an Explanatory analysis in order to better understand the distribution of some variables. 
Afterwards, I started some data manipulation techniques such as: removing reduntant variables, remove missing values and impact encoding.
In conclusion, I split the dataset into train and test set and I ran a Linear Regression Model which gave me the following metrics: 
Train R^2 score: 0.7520632077183226
Test R^2 score: 0.7369379113434464
Train MSE: 481224.17484060116
Test MSE: 415782.5267901252
